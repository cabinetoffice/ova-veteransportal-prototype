      Support for veterans
    </h1>
    <p>There is a lot of support available to veterans of the UK armed forces.</p>
    <p>You can use this service to find information according to your location and needs.</p>
    <p>It will not be able to assess whether you are eligible for all the services listed. But it will give you the most relevant information and cut out results that aren’t useful for you, including:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>specialist services that are funded by the government</li>
      <li>listings of charities and other non-government organisations that cater to veterans and their families</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can decide whether to contact charities and other organisations yourself, or you can choose to use the online referral service to be access help from a government service directly.</p>
